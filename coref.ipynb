These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and natural language understanding.  There's no single \"how it works\" answer, as different AI approaches use different methods. However, we can break it down into key concepts:\n","\n","**1. Data is King:**  AI systems learn from data.  The more relevant and high-quality data they are trained on, the better they perform. This data can be anything from images and text to sensor readings and financial transactions.\n","\n","**2. Algorithms are the Engine:**  Algorithms are sets of rules and statistical techniques that AI systems use to process data and learn patterns.  These algorithms are the \"brains\" of the system, determining how it analyzes information and makes decisions.  Different algorithms are suited for different tasks.\n","\n","**3. Learning Paradigms:**  Several approaches enable AI systems to learn:\n","\n","* **Supervised Learning:** The algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning each data point is tagged with the correct answer.  The algorithm learns to map inputs to outputs based on this labeled data.  Example: Training an image recognition system by showing it thousands of images labeled \"cat\" or \"dog.\"\n","\n","* **Unsupervised Learning:** The algorithm is trained on an unlabeled dataset.  It aims to discover patterns and structures in the data without explicit guidance.  Example: Grouping customers based on their purchasing behavior without pre-defined customer segments.\n","\n","* **Reinforcement Learning:** The algorithm learns through trial and error by interacting with an environment.  It receives rewards for desirable actions and penalties for undesirable ones, learning to maximize its cumulative reward.  Example: Training a robot to navigate a maze by rewarding it for reaching the goal and penalizing it for hitting walls.\n","\n","* **Deep Learning:** A subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers (hence \"deep\").  These networks can learn complex patterns from large datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results in areas like image recognition and natural language processing.\n","\n","**4. Models are the Output:**  The learning process results in a model – a mathematical representation of the patterns learned from the data.  This model is then used to make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data.  For example, an image recognition model might output \"cat\" when shown a picture of a cat.\n","\n","**5. Evaluation and Refinement:**  AI systems are constantly evaluated to measure their performance.  This involves testing the model on new data and comparing its predictions to the actual results.  Based on this evaluation, the model can be refined or retrained to improve its accuracy and performance.\n","\n","\n","**In simpler terms:** Imagine teaching a dog a trick.  You (the trainer) provide the data (showing the dog the trick), the algorithm is your training method (positive reinforcement, repetition), and the model is the dog's learned behavior (performing the trick).  The evaluation is seeing if the dog performs the trick correctly.\n","\n","It's important to note that AI is not a single technology but a collection of techniques.  The specific methods used depend heavily on the problem being solved.  While AI can achieve remarkable feats, it's crucial to understand its limitations and potential biases stemming from the data it's trained on.\n","\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["\n","def get_convo_prompt(history,current_question):\n","  prompt = f'''Role: You are a very advanced reasoning agent who understands the context of the conversation and can answer the questions based on the previous chain of question and answers.\n","\n","  Goal:\n","  Given the previous chain of question and answers and current question.you need to decide if the current question is dependent on context/data/answer of previous question or not.
