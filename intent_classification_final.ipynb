DeprecationWarning: `np.int` is a deprecated alias for the builtin `int`. To silence this warning, use `int` by itself. Doing this will not modify any behavior and is safe. When replacing `np.int`, you may wish to use e.g. `np.int64` or `np.int32` to specify the precision. If you wish to review your current use, check the release note link for additional information.\n","Deprecated in NumPy 1.20; for more details and guidance: https://numpy.org/devdocs/release/1.20.0-notes.html#deprecations\n","  dtype=np.int):\n"]}],"source":["# only essay feature is given in data, project_title  feature is not  available in\n","# given data\n","from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\n","tfidf= TfidfVectorizer(min_df=10, ngram_range=(1,2),max_features=10000)\n","tfidf.fit(train_df[\"text\"].values)\n","X_train_text_tdidf = tfidf.transform(train_df[\"text\"].values)\n","X_test_text_tfidf  =tfidf.transform(test_df[\"text\"].values)\n","print(X_train_text_tdidf.shape)\n","print(X_test_text_tfidf.shape)\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"_zA2PdTCAsjG"},"outputs":[],"source":["# stroing word:idf mapping in dictionary\n","dictionary = dict(zip(tfidf.get_feature_names(), list(tfidf.idf_)))\n","# storing vocab in a set\n","tfidf_words = set(tfidf.get_feature_names())"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"WW-lXNAkAtjP","outputId":"d644508a-890b-47f1-9221-3b0bfab52d41"},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["100%|██████████| 142/142 [00:00<?, ?it/s]\n","100%|██████████| 36/36 [00:00<00:00, 4724.50it/s]"]},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["(142, 300)\n","(36, 300)\n"]},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["\n"]}],"source":["# vectorization of text data.# only essay feature is given in data, project_title  feature is not  available in  given data\n","import numpy as np\n","\n","import pickle\n","with open(r\"D:\\ML\\ML AND DL\\APPLIED AI ASSIGNMENTS\\11_Donors_choose_GBDT\\glove_vectors\", 'rb') as f:\n","    model = pickle.load(f)\n","    glove_words =  set(model.keys())\n","\n","\n","def get_tfidf_w2v_vectors(X,dictionary,glove_words,tfidf_words,model) :\n","    from tqdm import tqdm\n","    tfidf_w2v_vectors = []\n","    for sentence in tqdm(X[\"text\"].values): # for each review/sentence\n","        vector = np.zeros(300) # as word vectors are of zero length\n","        tf_idf_weight =0; # num of words with a valid vector in the sentence/review\n","        for word in sentence.split(): # for each word in a review/sentence\n","            if (word in glove_words) and (word in tfidf_words):\n","                vec = model[word] # getting the vector for each word\n","                # here we are multiplying idf value(dictionary[word]) and the tf value((sentence.count(word)/len(sentence.split())))\n","                tf_idf = dictionary[word]*(sentence.count(word)/len(sentence.split())) # getting the tfidf value for each word\n","                vector += (vec * tf_idf) # calculating tfidf weighted w2v\n","                tf_idf_weight += tf_idf\n","        if tf_idf_weight != 0:\n","            vector /= tf_idf_weight\n","        tfidf_w2v_vectors.append(vector)\n","    return np.array(tfidf_w2v_vectors)\n","\n","X_train_essay_tfidf_w2v_vectors = get_tfidf_w2v_vectors(train_df,dictionary,glove_words,tfidf_words,model)\n","X_test_essay_tfidf_w2v_vectors = get_tfidf_w2v_vectors(test_df,dictionary,glove_words,tfidf_words,model)\n","\n","print(X_train_essay_tfidf_w2v_vectors.shape)\n","print(X_test_essay_tfidf_w2v_vectors.shape)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":456},"id":"CYiOAzuoAx91","outputId":"b31a43b6-2744-4bbb-98f2-20d2c301dc92"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["[13:39:35] WARNING: C:\\Users\\Administrator\\workspace\\xgboost-win64_release_1.2.0\\src\\learner.cc:516: \n","Parameters: { use_label_encoder } might not be used.\n","\n","  This may not be accurate due to some parameters are only used in language bindings but\n","  passed down to XGBoost core.
